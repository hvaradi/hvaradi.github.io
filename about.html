    <h1>Who is JAX?</h1>
    <h2>After several years of working together in the restaurant industry, business partners Woody Fox and Ed Manns decided to apply for a Golden Corral franchise in 1996. By 1997, they opened their first store in Statesville, NC. In December of 1999, they opened their  second Golden Corral, and have never looked back.</h2>
    <h2>Today, JAX LLC is currently operating twelve Golden Corral restaurants in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Pennsylvania, and still continues to grow.</h2>
    <h2>Throughout the years, various employees have joined our team to assist in the overall operation, including Bethany Bryan, the Executive Business Manager, and Kathy Ortiz, the AP Manager.</h2>
